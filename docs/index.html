    <h1>Privacy Policy for Stocked</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 1, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Stocked ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>1.1. Device Permissions</h3>
    <p>The App requires certain permissions to function correctly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> We use the camera to scan barcodes of food products and to take photos of products for your inventory.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> We access your photo library to allow you to select existing photos for your products.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2. Data Storage</h3>
    <p>Stocked uses Supabase, a cloud-based backend service, to store and synchronize your inventory data, shopping lists, and preferences across devices. Your data is stored securely in the cloud.</p>

    <h3>1.3. Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>We use the following third-party services which may collect information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> We use Supabase for authentication and data storage. Please refer to <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy">Supabase's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenFoodFacts:</strong> We query the OpenFoodFacts database to retrieve product information when you scan a barcode. Please refer to <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/terms-of-use">OpenFoodFacts' Terms of Use</a> and Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. We have configured the App to request <strong>non-personalized ads</strong>. However, AdMob may still collect and use your device's advertising ID and other data for frequency capping, aggregated ad reporting, and to combat fraud and abuse. You can manage your ad preferences in your device settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide and maintain the App's functionality (e.g., scanning barcodes, managing inventory, syncing data across devices).</li>
        <li>Facilitate workspace sharing with other users.</li>
        <li>Display advertisements (non-personalized).</li>
        <li>Improve the App's performance and user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share data with third-party service providers (like Supabase and Google AdMob) as described in section 1.3 to facilitate the services they provide.</p>
    <p>If you choose to share a workspace with other users, the data within that workspace (inventory items, shopping lists) will be visible to and editable by those users.</p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>5. Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>You have the right to request the deletion of your account and all associated data.</p>
    
    <h3>5.1. In-App Deletion</h3>
    <p>You can delete your account and all data directly within the App:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the <strong>Stocked</strong> app.</li>
        <li>Go to the <strong>Settings</strong> tab.</li>
        <li>Scroll down to the <strong>Danger Zone</strong>.</li>
        <li>Tap <strong>Wipe Data</strong> and confirm the action.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This will immediately delete your account, authentication data, and all inventory data associated with your user ID from our servers.</p>

    <h3>5.2. Manual Deletion Request</h3>
    <p>If you are unable to access the App, you may request account deletion by emailing us at <a href="mailto:schmidt@sdeveloper.cz">schmidt@sdeveloper.cz</a> with the subject "Account Deletion Request". Please include your registered email address. We will process your request and delete your data within 30 days.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
