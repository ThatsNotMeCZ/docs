    <h1>Privacy Policy for Stocked</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: November 27, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Stocked ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>1.1. Device Permissions</h3>
    <p>The App requires certain permissions to function correctly:</p>
    <ul>

        <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> We access your photo library to allow you to select existing photos for your products.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2. Data Storage</h3>
    <p>Stocked is primarily a local-first application. Your inventory data, shopping lists, and preferences are stored locally on your device using secure storage mechanisms.</p>

    <h3>1.3. Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>We use the following third-party services which may collect information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenFoodFacts:</strong> We query the OpenFoodFacts database to retrieve product information when you scan a barcode. Please refer to <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/terms-of-use">OpenFoodFacts' Terms of Use</a> and Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use your device's advertising ID and other data to serve personalized ads. You can manage your ad preferences in your device settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <li>Display relevant advertisements.</li>
        <li>Improve the App's performance and user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share data with third-party service providers (like Google AdMob) as described in section 1.3 to facilitate the services they provide.</p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>
